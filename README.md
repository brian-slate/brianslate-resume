# Brian Slate's Resume - SvelteKit App

This project is a dynamic, interactive resume built using SvelteKit. It showcases my skills, education, and employment history in a visually appealing format, and includes a feature to download the resume as a PDF.

## Features

- **Dynamic Content Loading**: Resume data is fetched dynamically from a static `JSON` doc and rendered using Svelte components.
- **Interactive UI**: The resume includes interactive elements like a PDF download button that converts the entire page into a downloadable PDF.
- **Responsive Design**: The layout adjusts for different screen sizes, ensuring a good user experience on desktops, tablets, and mobile devices.
- **Custom Components**: Utilizes custom Svelte components for various sections of the resume, such as `ProfileHeader`, `Skills`, `Employment`, and more.
- **Advanced CSS Styling**: Features like `PolygonBackground` and `HalftoneWave` add unique visual elements to the resume.
