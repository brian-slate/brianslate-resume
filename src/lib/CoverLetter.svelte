Hello Crunchyroll Team,

With over 15 years of software development experience, especially in building and optimizing developer tools and testing frameworks, I am thrilled at the prospect of contributing to Crunchyroll’s mission of enhancing anime accessibility globally. As a regular anime fan and a Crunchyroll user myself, I have a deep appreciation for the content and community you've built, and I'm eager to help expand its reach and impact.

At CI Solutions, as Director of Software Engineering, I led initiatives that developed robust tooling and observability solutions, significantly improving both build and test automation infrastructure. This experience aligns closely with the objectives of Crunchyroll, where I am enthusiastic about driving efforts that enhance developer productivity and support the integration of your services.

I hope the timing works out and we can connect!

Cheers,

Brian Slate
